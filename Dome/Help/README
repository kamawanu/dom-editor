Instructions for using Dome:

The main area shows the XML/HTML document you are editing on the right
and the code to manipulate it on the left. Clicking the right-mouse button
over the main area gets you a popup menu. You can use this, or the keyboard
short-cuts to edit the document.

To move to a node, just click on it. Hold down Ctrl to select multiple
nodes. Double-click a node to collapse/expand it. Shift-click selects
all nodes between the node clicked and the previously selected node.

Most of the menu items are fairly obvious. Here are a few notes though:

- Blank document deletes everything.

- Insert adds a new node just before the current one. Append adds the new
  node just after. Open puts the new node inside.

- 'Shallow' yank/delete only work on the selected nodes themselves, whereas
  the normal yank/delete affect the child nodes too.

- Operations on the root node often can't be undone.

- See www.w3.org for details of the XPath syntax.

- Entering a node makes that node appear to be the root node. You can then
  edit that subtree without worrying about the rest of the document. It's
  faster too, because redrawing lots of stuff is really slow.
  When you're done, use Leave to get back out. Undo will undo all changes
  made between the enter and the leave in one go.

- Select by XPath is really useful for processing lists. Here are some
  useful paths to use:

  - '*' selects all child elements of the current node.
  - 'li' selects all 'li' child nodes.
  - '//a' selects all anchor nodes anywhere in the document.
  - './/a' selects all anchor nodes anywhere inside this node.

- HTTP suck replaces an anchor node with the HTML document it points to.
  Select the attribute with the URI before using this.

- Don't worry about SOAP messages.

- Substitute works on text nodes. Standard regexp format, eg:
	Replace: .*(\d\d\d\d).*
	   With: \1
  will turn 'Born in 1957, England' into '1957'.

- Python expression lets you do more complex stuff, eg:
  - 'x.split()' splits the text into words.
  - 'int(x) + 1' increments a number.
  - 'x[:-1]' removes the last character.

- The Program menu is described below.

- Don't worry about the Show as ... items.



Once you can edit the document OK, you can start recording operations.
The green area on the left shows the currently selected program ('Root' to
begin with).

To record a sequence:

- Click on the black line below the 'Start' node (a yellow dot appears)

- Click on the Record button on the toolbar. The dot will turn red.

- Perform the operations on the document. Every operation you do will be
  added to the chain.

- Click Record again to stop recording.


To play back the recorded sequence, right-click on 'Root' (just above the
green area) and select Play. The yellow dot moves through the chain as each
operation is performed. The four buttons after Record can be used to stop,
step and resume playing.


The Program menu:

- Input pops up a dialog box. Whatever the user enters is placed on the
  clipboard.

- Compare succeeds if all selected nodes have the same value and structure.

- Fail always fails.

Dome is an visual programming language for manipulation of XML documents developed at the University of Southampton. It has been used in the AKT project to trawl through large websites, extracting information from them by transforming the source HTML into RDF.

Dome is written in Python and uses the 4suite and PyGTK libraries. It should run on any Linux or Unix system.

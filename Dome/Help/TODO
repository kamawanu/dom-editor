Remove duplicate namespaces on Leave

Enter->Leave bracketing (force Leave on exception)

Cut and paste loops.

Subtrees don't layout properly when there are several subtrees all together
(nodes and lines draw over the top of other nodes and lines).

It would be nice to be able to return to a chain after a failure case,
instead of having to copy and paste the same set of nodes onto the bottom of
a load of subtrees.

Better labels on programs

Make modify button work.

Back arrow (undo last program step and move back position of execution)

Ability to load files from within program.

After selecting a new program the program window should select the start
position (so you can click run straight away).

Menubar would be nice!

More sub-division in meus.

Labels on boxes that pop-up.

Clicking on program nodes should not bring up their contents (make this an
option on the right click menu instead?)

Clicking on the text of a node brigns it up for editing.

Double click on node attributes should not close the node but bring it up
for edit.

Clicking play in record mode should stop record mode.

There should be an extra type of undo - can undo a program node (remove
node) and undo actions of node at same time.

There should be an option to run the program without updating the gui until
it end/fails (if this speeds up execution).
